# 🚀 Universal Hub Lite

```lua
loadstring(game:HttpGet("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Angxers2/Unihub/refs/heads/lite/Unihub%20Lite%20V1.0.lua",true))()
```

**Universal Hub Lite** is a lightweight and performance-optimized version of the original **Universal Hub**, part of the *Universal Hub Family*. This version replaces the traditional GUI with a **chat-based interface**, making it perfect for players with lower-end PCs or anyone who prefers a more minimal, fast, and compact utility experience in Roblox.

---

## 🔍 Overview

Universal Hub Lite focuses on **efficiency and simplicity** by allowing players to control features using simple chat commands. No buttons, no sliders—just clean and quick functionality straight from the chat bar.

Whether you’re managing your character, teleporting, tweaking the environment, or running scripts, you can do it all just by typing in chat.

## ✨ Features

- 🧼 **Chat-Only Interface** – No visual GUI means cleaner screens and lower lag.
- 💻 **Optimized for Low-End Devices** – Super lightweight, almost no FPS impact.
- 🧰 **Full Suite of Commands** – Over 40 powerful utilities for manipulating gameplay.
- 🎯 **Focused & Minimal** – Built for speed, not bloat.
