## Notes

- Universal Hub is compatible with most games on Roblox, though certain games may have restrictions on features like walk speed, jump power, and fly.
- The script is continuously updated to improve compatibility and performance.
- For the best experience, use Universal Hub with the games listed as "Done."
- Discord will be open soon to suggestions
- This script will always be free and have no ads
- Still needs alot of development
- Angxers (me) is the only developer so it takes long for scripting
- Misc tab has just been started to work on so sorry for the lack of features
  

## Script 

- Paste this into your executor
> loadstring(game:HttpGet("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Angxers2/Unihub/main/Unihub%20V1.3.lua",true))()
